# freelancesite
This repo, as you might have inferred from my incredably creative name, is a website that I made for freelance work!

It also was a good excuse to practice/learn more about the Vue web framework. It's just meant to act as as simple landing page for my freelancing services. The site is built with the Vue web framework, and is hosted on AWS using s3 and cloudfront.

I used vuetify, a component library with various structure/css tools for layout design and basic components useful for any web-app. The site also applies a backend to power a contact form via gmail, which I have in a second repo.

## Project setup
There are two ways to check out this site, the easiest is to just check out the live version [here, at jacobbrooks.dev](https://www.jacobbrooks.dev). 

However if you'd like to check it out yourself locally then this is likely the simplest way to go about it:

0. Clone this repo!
1. You will require Vue!  You can find instructions on [installing Vue here](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html)
2. Vue provides a wonderful GUI for development. The ui can be started in your browser with the following command:
```
vue ui
```
3. Once open you can navigate the the 'Home' page via the icon on the bottom left of the page. Open the import tab, from here you can import the cloned repo as a Vue project.
4. Once imported you can open the project, and serve the porject with hot reloading by going to Tasks -> Serve, and hitting Run Task.
